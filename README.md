# ELA - Earthquake Location Algorithm
A study of earthquake location procedures.

The first attempt is to implement the classic Geiger method for earthquake location, where ray tracing is based on a modified TRVDRV subroutine written by \[[Eaton 1969](#eaton1969)\]. 1D velocity models may differ for seismic phases Pg, Pn, Sg, Sn, Lg.
